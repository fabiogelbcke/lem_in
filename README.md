# lem_in

Shortest path problem project for Ã‰cole 42. The goal is to get n ants across an anthill in the least number of turns possible.
Each ant can move once per turn and only one ant is allowed in each node of the graph unless it's the start or end.

The description of an anthill is given via stdin in the following format:

    3
    ##start
    a 23 3
    2 16 7
    #commentaire
    3 16 3
    4 16 5
    5 9 3
    6 1 5
    7 4 8
    ##end
    0 9 5
    0-4
    0-6
    a-3
    4-3
    5-2
    2-5
    3-5
    #autre commentaire
    4-2
    2-a
    7-6
    7-2
    7-4
    6-5

where:

The number in the first line is the number of ants
'a 23 3' represents a "house" in the anthill with name 'a' and coordinates 23, 3
##start and ##end indicate that the following "house" is the start or end
lines starting with # are coments
lines in the format a-b represent a connection between a and b


The coordinates of the houses are given just for people who wanna make a graphic representation, and make no difference whatsoever in finding the shortest path, as it's based on number of turns and not distance travelled.

The algorithm chosen was dijkstra algorithm, where the default distance between paths was 1, and was increased by 1 if there was already an ant in the house, and by n if there were n ants waiting in line to go to that house. With that, if there is a path with a nodes until the finish and a path with b nodes until the finish, where b > a, it will be more beneficial for an ant to take the path with b nodes if there are at least b - a - 1 ants waiting to go to the path with a nodes, and the path with b nodes is clear.
